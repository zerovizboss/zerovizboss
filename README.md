- 👋 Hi, I’m @zerovizboss
- 👀 I’m a Senior|Lead Salesforce Developer|Consultant|Solutions Architect with extensive Salesforce experience.  I've managed and lead several teams both off-shore and on.  My full stack development experience ranges from writing custom Salesforce Apex classes & triggers on the back-end through custom LWC's, Omnistudio (LCNC) and Experience Cloud on the Front-End.  Multiple projects involved working with REST/ SOAP API's integrated with multiple different databases, both legacy on-prem and data lakes.  In addition to Salesforce development, I also have a background in SQL doing data normalization and performance tuning as a DBA.  I have additional experience in C#, C++, Linux, DOS, and have dabbled in some other languages.  My Front-End development consists of Xamarin, Javascript, Joomla! and naturally HMTL, CSS.  I'm looking to improve my FE development as it's not as strong as my BE.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Javascript development skills due to the growing demand for Front-End developers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me grow my diverse background as I'm consistently called on to consult in different arena's with multiple environments.

<strong><em>Fun Times:</em></strong>
When I'm not working on a project or doing development, I'm enjoying the outdoors, crafting my metal shop or rebuilding my project truck.  Development is just one small way I like to use my brain and keeps me sharp and current with the times, but I like creating things with my hands.  Another aspect of my life that I really take pride in is helping others through volunteering, I like to bring hope where there is none and I like to encourage people who are going through hard times.

My repo doesn't reflect much as most of my projects are client specific and simply can't be shared.  I'm working to become more involved in the developer's community to grow my network and share my expertise with others.
